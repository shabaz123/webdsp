Wave Miner WebDSP
=================

Introduction
------------

webdsp can be used to generate signals, or to perform measurements on signals. The signals can be audio related, or can arrive from sensors. webdsp is software that runs on the Raspberry Pi (or on any Linux machine using dummy data mode) and allows the user to go to web pages and control and measure/monitor the siganls.

webdsp uses a Pi connected to a hardware Digital Signal Processor (DSP) card called Wave Miner. The Wave Miner hardware is very low cost (about $40-50 USD) and can be constructed within half a day (it uses a ready-made DSP module, so the assembly process involves just a bit of basic through-hole soldering mostly) onto a simple printed circuit board (PCB). Refer to the [waveminer GitHub page](https://github.com/shabaz123/waveminer) for the parts list and PCB files.

webdsp contains just three application todays, called **freqresp_web.js**, **rms_web.js** and **sine_web.js**. When you run them, you can go to a browser and navigate to:
**http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8081/freqresp.html** or **http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8081/rms.html** or **http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8081/sine.html** depending on which app you run; the details on how to run an app are below.

(replace **xx.xx.xx.xx** with the correct IP address of course). 

The freqresp_web.js app will run commands that control and query a DSP board, and will then send the results to the browser page, for displaying in a chart.

The rms_web.js app will control the DSP board and retrieve AC RMS measurements for displaying on the screen.

The sine_web.js app will allow sinewaves to be generated by the DSP board with settings configured on the web page.

Notes
-----
webdsp apps can be run with the Wave Miner hardware card, or they can be run in a dummy data mode. If you're using the Wave Miner hardware then webdsp apps needs to be installed on the Raspberry Pi that the hardware card is connected to. If you're using the dummy mode then you can install webdsp apps on any Linux box using any user account.

webdsp with the Wave Miner card was tested on a Raspberry Pi 4. Some paths are hard-coded for the pi user account if you're using the Wave Miner card. You will need to edit the code to modify the paths, if a different user account is used on the Pi. It is suggested to use the pi user account (create it if it doesn't exist) and then no paths need changing.

Prerequisites
-------------
webdsp apps with the Wave Miner card needs **waveminer** to be installed, since webdsp apps run executables from waveminer. Follow the instructions at the [waveminer GitHub page](https://github.com/shabaz123/waveminer) to install it.

If you do not have a Wave Miner card attached to the Pi or any other Linux box, then you don't need to install the waveminer software, and you can run webdsp apps in a dummy mode.

In either mode, webdsp requires **node.js** and **socket.io** to be available. To install these, type:

    sudo apt-get update
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_17.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    sudo npm install -g socket.io

Installing all webdsp apps
--------------------------
To install, type:

    mkdir -p ~/development
    cd ~/development
    git clone https://github.com/shabaz123/webdsp.git
    chmod 755 webdsp/*_web.js

Running the apps
----------------
To run the apps with the Wave Miner card, type:

    cd ~/development/webdsp

Next, type:

    ./freqresp_web.js

or

    ./rms_web.js

or

    ./sine_web.js
  
 Now you can go to **http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8081/freqresp.html** or **http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8081/rms.html** or **http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8081/sine.html**
 
 If you don't have a Wave Miner card then you can run webdsp in a dummy mode by typing:
 
    cd ~/development/webdsp
 
 then type:
 
    ./freqresp_web.js dummy

or

    ./rms_web.js dummy

or

    ./sine_web.js dummy
